As a team member, Adam worked together with Raj and completed a vast majority of the backend of the project. Adam also
conducted most of the major testing and was the first person to suggest applications/software to use for the project.
The use of the Gradle build dependency control was Adams idea, and he provided assistance consistently in the use and
