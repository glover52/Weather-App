Production Testing:
    Create small tests to verify individual methods, to ensure their correct operation.

Acceptance Testing:
  -Information from BOM and forecast.io is retrievable.
    --Check data requests do not equal null
  -Forecast information is displayed in a chart and table
    --Assert existence of DetailWindow object, JFreeChart chart and JFreeChart panel, as
    well as JTable
  -Graphs are created dynamically, and can be adjusted in real time
    --Visual test, when checkbox for a value is checked, it is displayed on the graph
  -Any data that can be retrieved, may be graphed
    --Visual test, find oldest forecast.io/bom weather data available, select range from
    oldest to current time.
  -Forecast and Observation are separate.
    --Separate buttons to display forecast and past observations.

Service and Repair Testing:
    N/A

Regression  Testing:
    Run selection of tests in the src/test/java file that should pass, indicating that
    the changes made allow the product to work.

Test Coverage:
    What requirements will be verified during which stages of the product life.
    -Functional Requirements are addressed in the early stages of the development cycle of
    the product. Minimum Viable Build includes all functional requirements.

Test Methods:
    How test coverage will be implemented.

Requirements:
    Retrieve forecast information from forecast.io

    Forecast information should be displayed anytime a area is selected

    Graphs should allow the user to select what is displayed

    Graphs should allow you to view any information that has been collected for a station.

    It should be easy to distinguish between Forecast and past Observations
